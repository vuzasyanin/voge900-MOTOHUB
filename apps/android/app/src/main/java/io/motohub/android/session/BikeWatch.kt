/**
 * Whether MOTO-HUB should keep looking for the motorcycle with nobody watching the screen.
 *
 * Pure so it can be tested, and so the reasons live in one place instead of being spread over
 * three lifecycle callbacks. Every clause is a "no" the rider or the session has already given:
 *
 * - [autoConnectEnabled] is the rider's own setting. Off means off, including in the pocket.
 * - [hasSavedMotorcycle]: there is nothing to look for otherwise.
 * - [riderCancelled] is the clearest "no" the UI has. [HubViewModel.cancelConnection] leaves the
 *   phase at NETWORK_SETUP_REQUIRED, which is exactly the phase auto-connect waits for. A watch
 *   that outlived a cancel would be the cancel bug again, only invisible.
 *
 * The phases that qualify are every phase in which a link is wanted and none exists:
 * NETWORK_SETUP_REQUIRED (where a session that has not connected sits), ERROR (where a 30s
 * timeout leaves it), and the two in-flight phases. The in-flight ones are deliberate and are
 * the case that matters most: rider 36a3fd37 left the app FIVE SECONDS into an attempt, while
 * the phase was DISCOVERING_TBOX, and the attempt only failed half a minute later with the app
 * already in the background. [BikeWatch.arm] can only be called while MOTO-HUB is still on
 * screen - Android refuses a foreground service started from the background - so a watch not
 * armed on the way out cannot be armed afterwards, and refusing to arm during an attempt would
 * miss exactly the rider this exists for.
 *
 * SETUP_REQUIRED is excluded because pairing is not finished, and READY / REQUESTING_PROJECTION /
 * CAPTURING because the motorcycle is already there: a notification saying "waiting for the
 * motorcycle" beside a running session is a lie.

/**
 * Keeps MOTO-HUB alive and foreground-eligible while the rider waits for the bike to come up.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Rider 36a3fd37 (CFMOTO 800NK, POCO / HyperOS, 2026-09-02) described the gap
 * exactly: "I open the app and it automatically starts up. Then I open the CFMoto app to start
 * the motorcycle and put my phone in my pocket. I start the motorcycle and open MotoPlay hoping
 * that Moto Hub will open automatically. But it never does." His log agrees to the second - the
 * app asked once at 08:44:00, he left for the other app at 08:44:05, the attempt timed out at
 * 08:44:34, the dash only came up around 08:45, and when he brought MOTO-HUB back himself at
 * 08:45:51 it joined in 3239ms. The bike had been there.
 *
 * Two things defeated the in-app retry loop, and this object answers both:
 *
 * 1. Android refuses a `WifiNetworkSpecifier` request from a process that is neither a foreground
 *    app nor a foreground service (see [io.motohub.android.MainActivity.connectWhenAndroidAccepts]),
 *    which is why the watch loop only ran while the activity was on screen. A foreground service
 *    clears that bar - IMPORTANCE_FOREGROUND_SERVICE is the exact threshold the platform reads.
 * 2. The process did not survive the pocket at all. That log records eight kills in three days,
 *    always from `importance=cached` (SwipeUpClean, clean_up_mem). Nothing running means nothing
 *    retrying, whatever the interval. A foreground service is not cached.
 *
 * The service holds no connection logic of its own on purpose. The retry stays where every brake
 * already lives - the activity's `attemptAutoConnect`, with its phase guard, cooldown, and the
 * rider's cancel - and this only buys that loop the right to run.
