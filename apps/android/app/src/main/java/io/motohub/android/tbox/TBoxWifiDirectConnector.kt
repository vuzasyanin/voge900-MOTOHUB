/**
 * Joins a CFMoto dash that runs as a **Wi-Fi Direct Group Owner** (SSID `DIRECT-...`, e.g.
 * CL-C450 / some "go" units) instead of a normal WPA2 access point. [TBoxNetworkConnector]'s
 * `WifiNetworkSpecifier` cannot associate to a P2P Group Owner as a proper client, so those
 * dashes need this path.
 *
 * Adapted from OpenCfMoto's `BikeWifiP2p`, with extra robustness: a peer-discovery kick before
 * connect (required on some devices), fast failure when P2P is off, an immediate check for a
 * pre-existing group, and a single-settle guard against duplicate connection broadcasts.
 *
 * Joins by credentials (`setNetworkName` + passphrase from the saved [MotorcycleProfile]) as a
 * legacy P2P client, then resolves:
 *  - the bike gateway (the Group Owner, always `192.168.49.1` by Android's P2P convention), and
 *  - the phone's own `192.168.49.x` address on the `p2p-*` interface.
 *
 * A P2P group produces no `ConnectivityManager.Network`; the caller binds its sockets to the
 * returned phone address instead (see [TBoxLink.WifiDirect]).
