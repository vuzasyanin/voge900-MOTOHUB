# Android Client

MOTO-HUB client for Android 14/API 34 and later.

## Local Build

Use the JDK bundled with Android Studio and an Android SDK with API 36:

```bash
export JAVA_HOME="/Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/jbr/Contents/Home"
export ANDROID_HOME="$HOME/Library/Android/sdk"
./gradlew testGithubDebugUnitTest
./gradlew assembleGithubDebug
```

The system JDK 26 is not compatible with the current Gradle/AGP combination.

The app has two product flavors on the `channel` dimension. They share
`applicationId` `io.motohub.android` and the same `versionName` / `versionCode`:

| Variant | Channel | In-app GitHub APK updates | `REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `githubDebug` / `githubRelease` | GitHub Releases | yes | yes |
| `rustoreDebug` / `rustoreRelease` | RuStore | no | no |

`github` is the default flavor. In Android Studio, open `apps/android` and pick
the variant in **Build Variants**. `assembleDebug` / `assembleRelease` build
both channels; use `assembleGithubRelease` or `assembleRustoreRelease` for a
single artifact.

Outputs:

```text
app/build/outputs/apk/github/debug/
app/build/outputs/apk/github/release/
app/build/outputs/apk/rustore/debug/
app/build/outputs/apk/rustore/release/
```

The public source intentionally excludes the Android Auto identity files. A normal build supports mirroring and T-Box streaming; Android Auto is enabled only when the files are supplied through the root `tooling/private/android-auto/` directory and the build is invoked with `-PincludeAndroidAutoIdentity=true`. Official GitHub and RuStore release APKs are built with those inputs through encrypted GitHub Actions secrets and include Android Auto without requiring user configuration.

For a local Android Auto build:

```bash
./gradlew -PincludeAndroidAutoIdentity=true assembleGithubDebug
```

A default assemble without `-PincludeAndroidAutoIdentity=true` excludes the identity and therefore cannot start Android Auto. See the root [`documentation/PUBLIC_RELEASE.md`](../../documentation/PUBLIC_RELEASE.md) for the maintainer release process.

Store upload (RuStore) must use the rustore flavor with Android Auto identity:

```bash
./gradlew -PincludeAndroidAutoIdentity=true assembleRustoreRelease
./gradlew -PincludeAndroidAutoIdentity=true exportRustoreStoreApk
```

Do not upload a `github` APK to RuStore: it still declares `REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES`.

Optional App Bundle for the store console:

```bash
./gradlew -PincludeAndroidAutoIdentity=true bundleRustoreRelease
```

## Transport Status

`hudlib.aar` is generated from the GPL-3.0 fork and included in the module.
After discovery, the UI enables the Android picker and the foreground service
starts the EasyConn handshake, AVC encoder and frame delivery. Local Wi-Fi and
transport remain separated from the service through `TBoxTransport` and its
session registry.

Primary pairing uses the EasyConn QR code: hosts `carbit.com` and
`carbit.com.cn` with an `ssid` parameter are accepted; passwords and metadata
are not written to logs. SSID and password are remembered between launches;
the password is encrypted with AES-GCM using a non-exportable Android Keystore
key. Manual entry remains available as a fallback and updates the same
persistent profile.

The network request uses the QR-provided SSID and password, then waits for a
usable IPv4 address on the exact Android network returned for that request.
T-Box firmware may use different private DHCP subnets. Host, port and package are passed to the Go session with
`setECHost()`, and the handshake runs on the primary T-Box Wi-Fi network.
TFT configuration events, fatal errors and network loss stop the projection
session through one idempotent cleanup path.

The optional `PHONE DISPLAY` mode darkens the physical panel five seconds after
startup while keeping it on so that `MediaProjection` is not terminated. It
requires Android's "draw over other apps" consent. The foreground notification
can restore the panel or darken it again; the Power button locks the phone and
still terminates projection according to Android policy.

`NETWORK DIAGNOSTICS` runs four local checks without enabling a VPN:
connection to the discovered T-Box, cellular TCP through `SocketFactory`,
cellular TCP through `Network.bindSocket()` and UDP DNS through `bindSocket()`.
The report is the technical gate before implementing a VPN bridge for other
apps; it does not change the default network, SSID or password.

For a QR photograph or a code shown on another display, use `IMPORT QR PHOTO`:
the Android Photo Picker passes the original file to ML Kit, avoiding autofocus
and moire caused by recapturing it with the camera.
