# VOGE 900DSX MOTOHUB

This repository is a **clone of [MOTO-HUB](https://github.com/vincenzobpt/MOTO-HUB)**, remade specifically for **VOGE 900DSX** motorcycles.

The original MOTO-HUB is a multi-brand EasyConn / Carbit dashboard project. This fork keeps that core — T-Box pairing, Android Auto on the TFT, screen mirroring, handlebar controls — and focuses day-to-day work on the VOGE 900DSX.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Upstream community and support live on the original [MOTO-HUB Discord](https://discord.gg/uCUK55nJ5v). You can also add the free [MOTO-HUB ADVANCED](https://github.com/vincenzobpt/MOTO-HUB-PRO-releases) companion from the original project.

> [!WARNING]
> **This is an experimental proof-of-concept, not a production-grade product.** It is developed and tested against a **VOGE 900DSX** dashboard. Behavior may be unstable, require a retry, or differ on other motorcycles, T-Box firmware versions, or phones. Do not depend on it as your only source of critical navigation information. Plan your route before riding, and use the software at your own risk.

VOGE 900DSX MOTOHUB is an Android 14+ application for connecting a phone to the motorcycle T-Box and projecting content to the VOGE 900DSX TFT display.

It projects **Android Auto** and **phone screen mirroring** (whole screen or a single app) to the TFT, drives Android Auto from the **motorcycle's own handlebar buttons**, and provides local diagnostics. It is a personal, local-first fork of MOTO-HUB and is not affiliated with or endorsed by VOGE, Loncin, or any other vehicle or software vendor.

## Supported Motorcycles

This fork is built **specifically for the VOGE 900DSX**. That is the motorcycle it is developed and validated against.

Upstream MOTO-HUB talks to the EasyConn / Carbit dashboard stack used by several brands (CFMOTO, Voge, Zontes, Moto Morini, Benelli, QJ Motor, Morbidelli / MBP, and others). Those dashboards are not rejected here either — pairing still uses the rider's QR code or manual SSID — but they are **not** the target of this fork. If you ride something other than a 900DSX, use [upstream MOTO-HUB](https://github.com/vincenzobpt/MOTO-HUB).

## Core And MOTO-HUB ADVANCED

Upstream MOTO-HUB is split into two applications. **This repository is the Core clone** — the app that owns the T-Box connection and the Android Auto receiver, and the only one you need to project. It is remade for the VOGE 900DSX.

| | VOGE 900DSX MOTOHUB (this repository) | [MOTO-HUB ADVANCED](https://github.com/vincenzobpt/MOTO-HUB-PRO-releases) (upstream) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| T-Box pairing, garage, connection | ✅ | uses Core over IPC |
| Screen mirroring (full screen or one app) | ✅ | — |
| Android Auto on the TFT | ✅ | — |
| Handlebar button control | ✅ | — |
| USB external display (AOA) | ✅ | — |
| Diagnostics, logs, in-app updates | ✅ | ✅ |
| Ride Dashboard (native GPS scene on the TFT) | — | ✅ |
| Navigation (search, routing, route preview) | — | ✅ |
| Trip recording, history, GPX export | — | ✅ |

ADVANCED is a free companion from the original MOTO-HUB project: it is installed alongside Core and reaches this repository's T-Box transport and Android Auto receiver through a documented Binder IPC boundary. **ADVANCED requires Core to be installed; Core does not require ADVANCED.** Install both to get everything. IPC compatibility with upstream ADVANCED is not guaranteed on this fork.

## Download The Latest APK

For the latest manually published Android package, visit the [latest release](https://github.com/vuzasyanin/voge900-MOTOHUB/releases/latest).

On the release page, expand **Assets** and download the file ending in `.apk`. Do not download **Source code (zip)** or **Source code (tar.gz)**: those files contain the project source, not an installable application. Android may ask you to allow installation from this source the first time; this is a normal Android security prompt for APKs installed outside Google Play.

## Permissions And Privacy

This app is local-first. The permissions below are used to connect to the motorcycle, scan its pairing QR code, keep an active projection running, and give the rider controls. The app does not require an account and does not upload screen content.

### Permissions requested while using the app

| Permission | When it is requested | Why it is needed | What it does not mean |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Camera** | When you choose live QR scanning | Reads the T-Box QR code shown on the motorcycle TFT | The camera is not needed for normal streaming, and camera frames are not intentionally recorded or uploaded |
| **Nearby devices / Wi-Fi** | When you connect to a saved or newly paired motorcycle | Finds and requests the motorcycle's Wi-Fi access point, then communicates with the local T-Box | It is not Bluetooth tracking and does not grant access to unrelated nearby devices |
| **Location** | Alongside the Wi-Fi permission, when connecting to the T-Box | Android requires location permission for Wi-Fi discovery and network requests | MOTO-HUB does not track or record the rider's position: this app has no GPS features, requests no location updates, and sends no coordinates anywhere |
| **Bluetooth** | Only when you enable handlebar button control | Identifies the connected dashboard so its button presses can be told apart from a headset's | It does not scan for or connect to other Bluetooth devices |
| **Microphone** | Only when you use the Android Auto voice assistant | Carries your voice to Android Auto while it is projecting | Audio is passed to Android Auto for the active request and is not recorded to disk or uploaded by MOTO-HUB |
| **Notifications** | When starting projection on Android 13 and newer | Shows the required foreground-service status and gives you visible controls to stop or manage an active session | It is not remote telemetry; notifications stay on the phone |

### System confirmations and optional access

| Access | When it is used | Why it is needed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Screen sharing confirmation** | Every time you start phone mirroring, app-specific sharing, or the USB external display | Android requires the user to approve capture of the whole display or a selected app. MOTO-HUB cannot approve this silently |
| **Install unknown apps** *(optional)* | Only if you install an update offered by the in-app release check | Android requires this to hand a downloaded APK to the package installer. Declining it simply means updating manually from the releases page |
| **Display over other apps** *(optional)* | Phone-display dimming during projection, and starting navigation from a handlebar button while another app is in front | Places a non-touchable overlay over the phone display to reduce brightness while the TFT continues receiving the projection, and lets a background button press launch navigation |

### Technical permissions granted by Android

The app also declares network and foreground-service permissions required by Android for this workflow: Internet and network-state access, Wi-Fi state/change access, Wi-Fi multicast discovery, foreground services for media projection, connected devices and microphone, and a wake lock. These maintain the local T-Box connection and the projection; they are not separate user accounts or remote services.

The Android Auto receiver also declares package visibility for Android Auto and Google Play services so MOTO-HUB can detect and launch the installed Android Auto component. This does not give MOTO-HUB access to Google account data.

### If a permission is denied

The app should continue to open normally. Only the related feature is unavailable: without Camera, use QR import from a photo, manual pairing, or an already saved motorcycle; without Nearby Wi-Fi or Location, the T-Box connection cannot be discovered; without Notifications, projection cannot be kept as a managed foreground session; without screen-capture approval, mirroring cannot start; without Bluetooth, handlebar buttons cannot be identified; without Microphone, the Android Auto assistant has no voice input. Optional display dimming simply remains disabled unless overlay access is granted.

## What It Does

- Pair with a motorcycle T-Box by scanning its QR code, importing a photo of it, or entering the network manually.
- Read the QR dialects other manufacturers use — such as Moto Morini's MotoFun code — and accept an unrecognized one after a warning rather than refusing it.
- Store multiple motorcycle profiles and select the active motorcycle.
- Store a private motorcycle photo and use it throughout the app UI.
- Connect to the T-Box Wi-Fi access point without requiring manual SSID entry, with a separate Wi-Fi Direct path for dashboards that advertise a `DIRECT-` network.
- Discover the EasyConn service and establish the T-Box session.
- Mirror the entire phone screen or a single Android app.
- Start Android Auto through an embedded local head-unit receiver, including on Android Auto versions that no longer accept a direct start request.
- Drive Android Auto from the motorcycle's handlebar buttons, after a short guided calibration, with per-motorcycle mappings for press, double press and hold.
- Control music volume, jump to a saved destination, or open the assistant from the handlebar without touching the phone.
- Stream the phone screen to a USB (AOA) external display, independently of the T-Box.
- Choose the Android Auto TFT layout per motorcycle:
  - `FIT`: preserve the complete image and use black bars when necessary.
  - `STRETCH`: use the complete available TFT area with geometric stretching.
  - `CROP`: use the complete available TFT area without stretching and crop edges when necessary.
- Calibrate per-motorcycle TFT safe margins so Android Auto video and touch stay inside the projection area not occupied by native motorcycle UI.
- Let Android Auto lay out at the dashboard's real shape instead of a letterboxed band inside it.
- Keep the phone preview available for Android Auto touch control, or disable the touchscreen entirely and ride with focus and handlebar controls.
- Select Smoother, Balanced or Sharper image detail, and a Smooth/Balanced/Saver/adaptive power behavior for the next stream.
- Override Android Auto with landscape or portrait SD/HD source resolutions, or keep automatic selection.
- Optionally connect to the saved motorcycle when MOTO-HUB opens.
- Optionally recover or seamlessly resume a stalled or dropped TFT stream when the T-Box returns.
- Show persistent diagnostics, run network tests, and share application logs as an exported file for troubleshooting.
- Check GitHub releases and pre-releases from inside the app, showing release notes before installing a newer APK.
- Run in English, Italian, Portuguese, Korean or Russian, or follow the phone language.

## Current Status

The current Android client is version `1.1.33` (`127`) and targets Android 14/API 34 and newer.

This build is developed against a VOGE 900DSX T-Box. Compatibility with a given phone, T-Box firmware version, or Android Auto version is not guaranteed and must be validated separately. For other motorcycles, see [upstream MOTO-HUB](https://github.com/vincenzobpt/MOTO-HUB).

Mirroring, Android Auto, handlebar controls and diagnostics are implemented, but every motorcycle model and T-Box firmware still requires explicit validation before it can be considered supported. The USB external display path is newer and has had less validation than the T-Box path.

This is still an experimental project. Do not rely on it as the only navigation or safety system, and configure navigation while stationary.

```

The public repository contains only the MOTO-HUB source, documentation, build metadata, and non-sensitive required artifacts. External projects are referenced by their public URLs below and are not vendored into this repository.

## Build Requirements

- **JDK 21.** Gradle 8.13 / AGP 8.12.3 do not run on newer JDKs, and the JDK bundled with current Android Studio versions is too new — point `JAVA_HOME` at a JDK 21 explicitly.
- Android SDK platform/API 36.
- A physical Android device. An emulator cannot reproduce the motorcycle Wi-Fi, camera, NSD, or Android Auto behavior.
- A generated `hudlib.aar` from the MOTO-HUB ridedaemon fork.

From `apps/android/`:

```bash
export JAVA_HOME="/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@21/libexec/openjdk.jdk/Contents/Home"
export ANDROID_HOME="$HOME/Library/Android/sdk"

./gradlew lintDebug testDebugUnitTest assembleDebug
```

The generated Android binding is expected at:

```text
apps/android/app/libs/hudlib.aar
```

To rebuild it, install Go and `gomobile`, then run these commands from the directory that contains the `voge900-MOTOHUB` folder:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vincenzobpt/ridedaemon-lib ridedaemon-lib
cd ridedaemon-lib
gomobile bind -target=android -androidapi 34 -o ../voge900-MOTOHUB/apps/android/app/libs/hudlib.aar ./hud/api
```

The source commit and AAR checksum must be updated in [`tooling/ridedaemon.lock`](tooling/ridedaemon.lock) whenever the artifact changes.

### Android Auto release builds

The public source intentionally does **not** contain the static Android Auto head-unit identity (`aa_cert` and `aa_identity_data`) or the APK-signing keystore. Maintainer-built release APKs include Android Auto support and require no certificate setup or technical configuration from the user.

A normal source build without those inputs remains usable for pairing, T-Box streaming, mirroring, and diagnostics, but Android Auto reports that its identity is unavailable. This separation keeps private build inputs out of Git history; it does not make identity material embedded in a publicly downloadable APK confidential.

For a local Android Auto build, place the two identity files in `tooling/private/android-auto/` and run:

```bash
./gradlew -PincludeAndroidAutoIdentity=true assembleDebug
```

For a local build without Android Auto identity files, use the default build:

```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

Maintainers can find the complete release process and required GitHub secret names in [`documentation/PUBLIC_RELEASE.md`](documentation/PUBLIC_RELEASE.md).

## Android Features

### Motorcycle Garage

The garage stores multiple motorcycle profiles. Each profile can contain:

- T-Box SSID and encrypted Wi-Fi password.
- QR-provided metadata when available.
- A user-defined display name.
- A private motorcycle photo.
- Android Auto display format: `FIT`, `STRETCH`, or `CROP`.
- TFT safe margins used to exclude motorcycle-owned display regions from Android Auto video and touch.
- Its own handlebar button calibration and mapping.
- Observed T-Box capability snapshots, including model/profile hints where available.

Existing single-profile data is migrated automatically when the app is upgraded.

### Projection Modes

`Mirror` uses Android `MediaProjection` and supports either the complete phone display or an app selected through Android's system picker.

`Auto` runs Android Auto through a local Android Auto Projection receiver. The decoded Android Auto video is composited, encoded as H.264, and sent to the T-Box through the ridedaemon transport. The compositor supports `FIT`, `STRETCH`, and `CROP` against the usable TFT projection area. When Android Auto declares internal letterbox margins, `STRETCH` uses the active Android Auto content rather than stretching black bars. By default MOTO-HUB asks Android Auto to lay out at the dashboard's real shape, so the map fills the panel instead of sitting between black bars; the per-motorcycle TFT safe margins can be advertised instead by switching content insets to `Manual`.

`External` appears only when a USB (AOA) accessory head unit is attached. It captures the phone screen and writes H.264 access units straight to the USB accessory endpoint, completely independently of the T-Box, EasyConn and ridedaemon path.

The Ride Dashboard, Navigation and Trips are not part of this app — they live in [MOTO-HUB ADVANCED](https://github.com/vincenzobpt/MOTO-HUB-PRO-releases), which connects through this app's IPC boundary.

### If Android Auto does not start

Android Auto 17.4 removed the entry points an app could use to ask it to project: the activity it
used is no longer exported and the receiver behind it ships disabled, so MOTO-HUB's request is
refused or silently ignored. This affects every app of this kind, not only MOTO-HUB — the
`headunit-revived` project reports the same in its issue #698. Android Auto 17.2.662634 is verified
working; 17.4.663004 is not.

There is no need to install an older Android Auto. Android Auto can be asked to listen instead,
using the head unit server its own Desktop Head Unit connects to, and MOTO-HUB connects to that:

1. Open the **Android Auto** app, scroll to the bottom and tap **Version** ten times to reveal
   Developer settings.
2. In Developer settings, enable **Add new cars to Android Auto** (older wording: *Unknown
   sources*).
3. Open the **⋮ menu at the top right** of Developer settings and choose **Start head unit
   server**. It lives in that menu, not in the list of settings below it. A notification confirms
   it is running, and it stays running until stopped or the phone restarts.
4. Start Android Auto from MOTO-HUB as usual. MOTO-HUB polls that server and connects on its own.

The same instructions are in the app under `Settings ▸ Android Auto does not start`, and the error
shown when projection fails links to them.

### Handlebar Buttons

These dashboards forward their handlebar buttons to the phone as ordinary Bluetooth media commands — a volume change, a play/pause, a next/previous track — and which physical press produces which command differs per motorcycle, and per brand. MOTO-HUB therefore starts from a **calibration**: the rider performs each press once, and the app learns what that motorcycle actually sends. Nothing is assumed from the model name.

Each calibrated press (`Up`, `Down`, `Left`, `Right`, `Select`, each as press, double press or hold) can then be mapped to an Android Auto action: rotary forward/back, D-pad, Select, Back, Home, the assistant, or one-press navigation to one of three saved destinations. Mapping, calibration and the on/off switch are stored per motorcycle. The feature is on by default, and MOTO-HUB keeps the media session it needs alive so the dashboard keeps sending presses instead of handing them to another app.

Music volume is expressed in **presses**, not steps, because that is how the dashboard rocker behaves.

### Settings

`Video quality` sets image detail against the negotiated base bitrate: `Balanced` is the recommended default, `Smoother` uses 70% and `Sharper` 160%. `Power mode` selects `Auto` (adapt bitrate and frame rate to phone temperature and Wi-Fi quality), `Smooth` (30 FPS), `Balanced` (24 FPS) or `Saver` (20 FPS). `Disable touchscreen` lets the rider use focus and handlebar controls even on a dashboard that reports a touch display.

`Android Auto` selects the source resolution — `Auto` (dynamic orientation from the learned T-Box geometry), 800 x 480, 1280 x 720, 720 x 1280 or 1080 x 1920 — and how content insets are advertised. The T-Box output canvas is still negotiated at runtime and is not replaced by the Android Auto source resolution.

`Connection & automation` holds auto-connect, which requests the saved motorcycle network and discovers EasyConn on app launch and after deliberate projection stops, and the optional recovery watchdog, which monitors outgoing TFT frame progress and rebuilds the T-Box network, discovery, handshake, and encoder path after a post-start stall while keeping the local Android Auto receiver alive. Seamless resume can park a projection across a longer T-Box interruption and resume when the motorcycle network returns.

`Diagnostics` provides network tests (T-Box discovery, Wi-Fi binding, cellular routes), the application log with copy/share/clear, a master switch that stops all logging — and with it the error reports described under [Crash and error reporting](#crash-and-error-reporting) — and verbose T-Box logging for protocol-level troubleshooting.

The general section holds the app language, launch-time update checks, and seamless resume.

### Network Behavior

The T-Box Wi-Fi network is a local display transport and may not provide Internet access. MOTO-HUB requests the T-Box network explicitly and keeps the T-Box transport separate from normal phone connectivity where Android allows it. OEM network behavior can vary, especially on OnePlus devices.

## Licensing And Publication Gate

This section is intentionally explicit because the project combines original MOTO-HUB code with external components and research.

- **This repository (a clone of MOTO-HUB) is licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPL-3.0)** — see [`LICENSE`](LICENSE). AGPL-3.0 was chosen because the repository combines GPL-3.0 material (`hudlib.aar`, the T-Box transport) with AGPL-3.0-derived material (`aa/`, the Android Auto receiver technique ported from `headunit-revived`); AGPL-3.0 satisfies both components' obligations for a combined work and additionally covers network-facing use.
- `ridedaemon-lib` and the reference Android project are distributed under AGPL-3.0 according to their repositories and license files; the generated `hudlib.aar` is derived from that fork. Redistributing it (including inside this repository) must comply with the applicable AGPL obligations — the corresponding source must remain available to anyone who interacts with it, including over a network.
- The `open-cfmoto` project used for research does not contain a license file in the reviewed source snapshot. No code from that project should be published as part of MOTO-HUB until its redistribution terms and attribution requirements are verified.
- **MOTO-HUB ADVANCED** is a separate, closed-source companion application maintained in a private repository. It contains no GPL-3.0 or AGPL-3.0 code — it reaches this repository's T-Box transport and Android Auto receiver exclusively through a documented Binder IPC boundary (`apps/android/ipc-contract/`, `IpcBridgeService`), which is why it can be distributed under different terms. ADVANCED requires MOTO-HUB to be installed to function; MOTO-HUB does not require ADVANCED.
- CFMOTO, Voge, Zontes, Moto Morini, MotoFun, Benelli, QJ Motor, Morbidelli, MBP, EasyConn, Carbit, MotoPlay, Android Auto, Google, and related names remain the property of their respective owners. This fork is an independent project and must not imply official support from any of them, including VOGE.

This README documents the project's licensing rationale; it is not a substitute for legal advice.

## Privacy Notes

MOTO-HUB is designed to operate without an account or proprietary telemetry service. It handles screen content, T-Box credentials, and diagnostic data on the phone. Wi-Fi passwords are encrypted with Android Keystore. Screen frames are processed in memory for the active projection and are not intentionally recorded to disk.

This app contacts two Internet hosts on its own: GitHub, to check for a newer release when you ask it to or when launch-time update checks are enabled, and Sentry, for crash and error reporting (see below). It has no maps, geocoding, routing or weather features, requests no location updates, and sends no ride or position data anywhere. Anything Android Auto itself does over the network is Android Auto's own traffic, under your Google account, not MOTO-HUB's.

### Crash and error reporting

Official MOTO-HUB release APKs report crashes and connection failures to [Sentry](https://sentry.io/), in its EU region. This exists because the failures that matter here — a dashboard that will not associate, a stream that dies mid-ride — take a motorcycle and a rider to reproduce, and a single rider's report rarely says whether it is one bike or one model.

What is sent:

- Crashes, and why a previous process of the app ended.
- Errors already written to the in-app diagnostic log, **redacted** and capped at 50 per app run. They are sent as plain messages, never as raw exception objects, precisely because the local log can contain connection details that must not leave the phone.
- Coarse tags used to group reports across riders — for example whether the dashboard's Wi-Fi network was visible at all in the moment before a failed join. Values are deliberately kept low-cardinality, so they describe a situation rather than a rider.
- The app version and build number, so a report can be attributed to a release.

What is not sent: Sentry's "default PII" collection is switched off, so no account, contact, device identifier or IP-derived user data is attached. Screen content, T-Box passwords, trips and position are never sent — the app has no position data to begin with.

Turning off `Settings ▸ Diagnostics ▸ Enable logging` stops the diagnostic log entirely, and with it the error events described above. Crash reports are handled by the Sentry SDK itself and are not covered by that switch.

**Builds from this source send nothing.** The Sentry DSN is supplied at build time from a private properties file or CI secret, exactly like the Android Auto identity. A source build without it has telemetry disabled outright, not merely unconfigured.

Review [Security and Privacy](documentation/SECURITY_AND_PRIVACY.md) before distributing an APK outside personal use.

The public source does not include the Android Auto identity or APK-signing keystore. APKs attached to official releases of this fork are complete runtime builds and include Android Auto support.
