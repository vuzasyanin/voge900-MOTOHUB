# Product Requirements

Status: current product requirements

## Vision

Allow the rider to use the motorcycle TFT as a flexible phone-powered display:
screen/app mirroring, full Android Auto, and a native Ride Dashboard can all
run through the T-Box without modifying the motorcycle hardware.

The phone produces every frame. The T-Box receives an H.264 stream and displays
it in the negotiated projection area. MOTO-HUB must keep three user-facing modes
separate: mirroring, full Android Auto, and Ride Dashboard. Ride Dashboard can
embed Android Auto inside its map region, but that must not collapse it into
the full Android Auto mode.

## Product Principles

- Capture consent must be explicit and visible.
- The UI must be usable before riding; during a ride it must require as few
  interactions as possible.
- The displayed state must match the actual session state.
- If the network or capture is lost, the session must end predictably or attempt
  a limited, visible reconnection.
- Do not promise capture of DRM or protected content.
- Do not invent motorcycle telemetry. Phone-derived values must be labelled as
  phone/GNSS values.
- Display and touch mapping must adapt to the real T-Box projection area, safe
  margins and motorcycle model profile.

## Primary Personas

- CFMoto owner who wants to use a navigator other than the official one.
- User who wants to project a dashboard, weather app or personal UI.
- Developer/tester who needs to measure compatibility and video parameters.

## Core Flow

1. The user opens HUB and starts motorcycle pairing.
2. HUB obtains T-Box network data through QR or manual entry.
3. Android displays consent for connecting to the local Wi-Fi network.
4. HUB verifies the network, EasyConn discovery and T-Box reachability.
5. The user selects Mirroring, Android Auto or Ride Dashboard.
6. The selected foreground service starts the T-Box session and encoder path.
7. HUB shows state, controls, diagnostics and a `Stop` action.
8. A user, system or T-Box stop releases all mode-specific resources.
9. If auto-connect is enabled, HUB reconnects to the saved motorcycle after the
   deliberate stop so the next mode can start quickly.

## Functional Requirements

### Onboarding and Network

- `FR-01`: read the T-Box QR using CameraX/ML Kit.
- `FR-02`: allow manual SSID and password entry as a fallback.
- `FR-03`: ask Android to connect to the local T-Box network without silently
  modifying networks.
- `FR-04`: detect and distinguish unavailable network, denied consent, failed
  discovery and failed handshake.
- `FR-05`: remember only non-sensitive metadata and, if the password is saved,
  protect it with Android Keystore.

### Source Selection

- `FR-06`: for mirroring, on Android 14 QPR2 or later, offer system-picker selection between a
  single app and the entire screen.
- `FR-07`: on earlier versions, offer full-screen capture when supported by the
  platform.
- `FR-08`: require new consent for every new projection session.
- `FR-09`: do not present a proprietary app list as if HUB could select or
  capture an app without system involvement.

### Streaming

- `FR-10`: negotiate the session through `ridedaemon-lib`.
- `FR-11`: wait for the T-Box safe-area configuration before considering the
  stream ready.
- `FR-12`: capture the projection onto a `Surface` accepted by `MediaCodec`.
- `FR-13`: send every AVCC access unit to `MobileSession.pushFrame()`.
- `FR-14`: use a live-only video source and restart delivery from a fresh
  SPS/PPS/IDR sequence whenever the T-Box attaches its media consumer.
- `FR-15`: support manual stop from the app and persistent notification.
- `FR-16`: treat `MediaProjection.Callback.onStop()` as the definitive stop of
  the current capture.

### State and Diagnostics

- `FR-17`: expose the states `Disconnected`, `Connecting`, `Ready`,
  `Consent required`, `Starting`, `Streaming`, `Reconnecting`, `Error`.
- `FR-18`: show actionable messages, without exposing raw protocol errors as the
  user's only information.
- `FR-19`: maintain a local, exportable diagnostic log with sensitive data
  removed.
- `FR-20`: share diagnostics as a generated text file when the user selects
  Share.

### Android Auto

- `FR-21`: start Android Auto through a local AAP receiver and self-mode launch.
- `FR-22`: include the Android Auto identity in maintainer-built APKs.
- `FR-23`: expose `FIT`, `STRETCH` and `CROP` per motorcycle.
- `FR-24`: support automatic and manual Android Auto source profiles.
- `FR-25`: keep phone preview/touch control available for non-touch TFTs.
- `FR-26`: support optional recovery/seamless resume after post-start stalls or
  T-Box interruptions.

### Ride Dashboard

- `FR-27`: render GPS speed, course, altitude, trip statistics, battery, link
  data and T-Box identity natively.
- `FR-28`: support OpenStreetMap as the native map source.
- `FR-29`: support embedded Android Auto as a replacement for the map region.
- `FR-30`: allow handlebar controls to cycle panels and toggle fullscreen.
- `FR-31`: expand map/embedded Android Auto into freed panel space.

### Trips, Updates And Settings

- `FR-32`: record trips manually or automatically with projection modes and native Navigation;
  a Navigation-owned recording must survive an interrupted Ride Dashboard or Android Auto session.
- `FR-33`: store trips locally, show them on an interactive map and export GPX.
- `FR-34`: on the GitHub channel, check GitHub releases/pre-releases and offer
  only a newer APK build. The RuStore channel updates through the store and
  must not request `REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES`.
- `FR-35`: allow users to disable touchscreen advertisement and configure
  handlebar timing/actions.
- `FR-36`: store per-motorcycle safe margins and apply them to Android Auto
  video/touch.

## Out Of Scope

- BLE control of media, alarms, notifications or motorcycle commands.
- CarPlay.
- Bypassing `FLAG_SECURE`, DRM or `MediaProjection` consent.
- Automatic Play Store publication.
- Claiming support for a motorcycle model without measured projection/touch
  validation.
- Native Waze/Google Maps replication including traffic, speed traps or
  proprietary navigation data.

## Platform Constraints

- The user selects a single app in the Android picker. HUB cannot silently
  preselect and start an arbitrary app.
- Protected windows may appear black in the stream.
- Screen locking, user revocation, another projection or process death may end
  the session.
- A foreground service and notification are mandatory during capture.
- The T-Box uses a local network that may not provide Internet access.
- Background operation also depends on OEM power-management policies.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- `NFR-01 Latency`: glass-to-glass goal below 500 ms; desired target below 300
  ms, to be measured on hardware.
- `NFR-02 Startup`: from an already-associated network to first frame within 15
  seconds in 90% of attempts.
- `NFR-03 Stability`: 60-minute continuous session without crashes or critical
  leaks.
- `NFR-04 Resources`: no unbounded video queue; prefer recent frames.
- `NFR-05 Temperature`: monitor thermal throttling in 30- and 60-minute tests.
- `NFR-06 Privacy`: no frame saved to disk and no remote telemetry.
- `NFR-07 Compatibility`: Android 14/API 34 minimum; app-window sharing only
  where available in the system.
- `NFR-08 Recovery`: all resources must be released within 3 seconds of stop.

## Acceptance Criteria

- A supported phone connects to the T-Box through QR or manual data.
- The TFT displays the complete screen with unprotected content.
- On Android 14 QPR2+, the TFT displays only the app selected in the picker,
  without system-included notifications and system UI.
- Full Android Auto fills, fits or crops according to the selected
  per-motorcycle mode.
- Ride Dashboard OpenStreetMap and embedded Android Auto expand correctly as
  panels are cycled and fullscreen is toggled.
- TFT and phone-preview touches land on the intended Android Auto controls.
- A recorded trip is accessible in Trips and exportable as GPX.
- The projected app can continue using Internet through an available network on
  at least the devices in the certification matrix.
- Screen lock, consent revocation and Wi-Fi disconnection do not leave an
  encoder, multicast lock or foreground service orphaned.
- A 60-minute test produces no continuous memory or latency growth.

## Open Product Questions

- Which CFMoto models and firmware versions will be declared supported?
- Is distributing the entire app under GPL-3.0, as required by the embedded
  library, acceptable?
- Which motorcycle-specific safe margins and touch transforms should become
  built-in defaults after real hardware measurement?
